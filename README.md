### Implement data lakehouse with-Azure-Databricks
Leverage Apache Spark on Azure Databricks to run big data engineering workloads in the cloud.

Description: This repository provides a hands-on guide to building a data lakehouse platform with Azure Databricks. You’ll learn how to use Apache Spark for large-scale
data engineering, manage workflows efficiently, and deliver reliable analytics in the cloud. The project covers everything from ingesting raw data to transforming it into 
trusted datasets ready for dashboards and reporting.
